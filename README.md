# Car-Rental

## Project overview
A small full stack project that is composed of a public folder that contains all the frontend files (html/css/js) and a nodeJs folder that contains all the backend files (nodeJs). The shop consists of a home page where all the users (logged or not) have access to it. After logging in or signing up the user will be redirected to a similar page like the home page but with some additional features (add car to shopping cart, adjust user profile, adjust cart, checkout). This projects uses pure js to dynamically fetch the cars, user profile data and the choices of the user (using JWT and cookies) and nodeJS to retrieve data from the database (mysql).
